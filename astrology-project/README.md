## ⚙️ How the Magic Works
The application relies on specific mathematical offsets to map inputs to curated data arrays:

| Category | Algorithm / Calculation |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Zodiac** | `zodiacSigns[month - 1]` |
| **Compliment** | `compliments[day - 1]` |
| **Support** | `year % 20` |
| **Ritual** | `(day * month) % 30` |
| **Future** | `(name.length * surname.length) % 20` |
